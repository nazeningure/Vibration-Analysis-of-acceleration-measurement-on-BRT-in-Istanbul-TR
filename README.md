This folder contains:
A) Trajectory Plot ofBus Rapid Transit System (BRT) on Sogutlucesme-BEylikduzu direction route via GPS coordinates and elevation normalized according to sea level upon barometer measurement.
B) VIBRATION ANALYSIS OF BRT for the acceleration measurement upon maximum energy dissipiation metrobus type and seat location that is From Beylikduzu to Sogutlucesme on the rear seat # 62 (not on suspension).
  B.1.) First add excel file in MATLAB folder under Documents. Then, run "Tez_metrobus_BS_GR62_arka.m". In this code Welch PSD is generated without generating data set. For better visualization and editing data sets, a follow up MAtlab ,m file is formed as decribed in B.2:
  B.2) After B.1., run "new_psd_new.m". However, if this second code in "new_psd_new.m" merged in (B.1) some problems may occur in figures. Therefore, it is advised to run as decribed.
